Warlock Visual Dots Project by Galgoroth

This collection of dynamic group weak auras will show a warlock all of the DoTs they currently have applied to a selected target. It will create a vertical status bar for each applied DoT and the color will change to indicate remaining
duration. (Green > Yellow > Orange > Red). The Icons that show below each bar, display the spell icon and are interactive to where you can hover over them and read their descriptions. 

There is a tic mark at the bottom of each bar, that estimates the last opportunity to cast and re-apply each DoT. This will help prevent clipping DoTs or dropping off spells and losing buffed effects from CD's. 

Current DoTs supported: Haunt, Shadow Embrace, Immolate, Unstable Affliction, Corruption, Curse of Agony, Curse of Tongues, Curse of Doom, Curse of Weakness, Drain Life, Drain Mana and Drain Soul. 

DoTs are ordered from shortest duration to longest duration, left to right, respectively. Channeled spells such as Drain Life/Mana/Soul will show on the far right during active channeling.

Please reach out with ideas for improvements or issues that need fixing. Above all else, I hope this helps you!
